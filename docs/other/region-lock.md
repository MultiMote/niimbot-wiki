# Region lock

Printers may be region-locked. This is not a hardware restriction.
Official app checks for region lock by sending the printer's serial number to the NIIMBOT server.

## What can I do?

So you need to contact seller to add your device to the whitelist and remove region lock.

The region lock has no effect on printing via third-party applications like [niim.blue](https://niim.blue).
